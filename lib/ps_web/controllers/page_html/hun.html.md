I'm Chris, a web developer during the week and a hill climber and walker at the weekends. I'm a keen photographer and usually take photos around Scotland.

This website is a personal record of my walks, hikes and climbs.

Yet Flash didn’t truly die — not everywhere. In one country, it’s still being updated even now, as recently as June 14. That country is China, where Flash meant something big from the minute it arrived in the late 1990s.

It’s hard to explain Chinese Flash animation to the outside world. When it appeared, it was different. Larger. In the early 2000s, the Flash scene wasn’t just a niche for anarchy and weirdness in China — it was a massive, generation-defining creative outlet. It was like early YouTube before early YouTube. As researcher Weihua Wu has argued, it was like the new rock and roll.1

That’s a bold comparison, but not baseless. Early Chinese Flash cartoons were the art of the internet, with all of the newfound freedom that entailed in China. Young artists and amateurs made their personal feelings public in raw, unfiltered ways — often for the first time. And they went viral in the process.

Which happened, in late 2002, to a Beijing artist named Bu Hua. She made a five-minute Flash animation, Cat (猫), that brought hundreds of thousands of people to tears. Then she was on China’s national news.

- A **Russian** court of appeals overturned a ruling on _Peppa Pig_ that had allowed a man to use the character in violation of international law. Apparently, the brand is protected in Russia again.
- Regular readers know that it’s graduation season in **China**. Don’t miss the [pictures and GIFs](food) coming out of the A Da Experimental Class at Beijing Film Academy.
- A tweet from **American** story artist Dylan Holden (_Monsters at Work_) caught our attention. “I think without fundamental change to the craft, we should more or less consider a new job title,” he [wrote](link). “Rough Story Animators.”

> Of course, everyone dreamed of getting an Oscar — this is the most important award in the film industry. We dreamed of being on Netflix. Not because there are millions there […] But simply because it’s a recognition of excellence. Now, with all of it out of reach, there has been a collapse of criteria among a huge number of my colleagues — how do I evaluate my work if a big foreign producer can’t tell me I’m doing well?

That said, the biggest problem remains the economic one. Russia’s most famous animation studio, Soyuzmultfilm, has been withering for the last four months. It’s a state asset, widely covered by state-run media — and it’d been growing quickly before the invasion. None of that has protected it.

Recently, Soyuzmultfilm head Yuliana Slashcheva projected that her company’s revenue would drop by 30% in 2022. It’s trying to find international partners to replace the ones it’s lost in Europe and beyond, recently signing a distribution deal in China for over 1,000 of its projects. But the losses won’t stop.

Since February, we’ve chronicled the effect that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is having on animation in both countries. These updates aren’t for everyone, but we feel it’s important to record this moment. It’s a microcosm of the disaster that Putin has caused.

Regular readers know that the invasion has dealt a self-inflicted blow to Russian film and TV, animation included. Boycotts and sanctions have cut it off from the money and recognition it needed to thrive. Everything is different — and not just economically. A quote from producer Dzhanik Fayziev put things into perspective this week:

## some paragraphs

When I first started writing [Hardcore Software](https://www.janefriedman.com/key-book-publishing-path/), I intended to take the traditional route and write a book. It seemed like such an obvious step and one I had done before for the book One Strategy.1 I was far along, but I retreated from that path at the last minute to find a new way to bring the story to life. I could not be more pleased with the outcome. I wanted to share the story and maybe others will see the benefits of using Substack as I did.2

Before describing the positive attributes I experienced on Substack, for the sake of comparison I wanted to offer some background from my own experience in the traditional book publishing world. Aside from reading a lot of books, my experience is of course limited to publishing one book, helping authors in early stages of their books (such as The Road Ahead and Business @ the Speed of Thought), writing the occasional book review for the Wall Street Journal, and then not publishing a book.

Publishing a book through a traditional, major, publishing house in New York is remarkably rewarding. With a physical book, especially one that shows up in local bookstores, there’s an incredible sense of pride and accomplishment. There’s nothing quite like being sent a photo from a family member of your book on a shelf at home or in a store. If you’re lucky enough to do a book tour or book signing, the feels grow even more. If you’re part of the very tiny number of books to get reviewed in the NY Times and potentially appear on their list, then you have the utmost seal of approval one could have for a book. For many that is career-worthy achievement. I never made it that far but did make it on the shelves of B&N in my hometown and that was quite a thrill. To those that accomplished one of these milestones, congratulations are well-deserved.

There are many reasons to write a book beyond just the belief in something to say. In business, many books serve to further a consulting or speaking agenda. Such books lend credibility along with a clear understanding of what the author has to offer. Some might be surprised to know that often an agreement to appear comes with a commitment to purchase a set number of copies of a book, which provides sales which in turn drives the potential to appear on best seller lists. Academic books are often a key part of the tenure process and serve to solidify an area of expertise. Reporters who cover companies or sectors often cap off their assignments by writing a book pulling together all their reporting.

The process of bringing a book to market, however, is one with a good set of challenges. Those in the industry generally suggest that the prestige that comes from traditionally printed book is because of the process that one goes through. There are many who have detailed the many steps and difficulties of the book publishing process. Tren Griffin (@tgriffin) has a great post on the subject in A Half Dozen Lessons About Writing and Getting Published based on his experience as a seven-time published author. Even the leading trade publication Publisher’s Weekly often shares the difficulties. The following table by [Jane Friedman](https://www.janefriedman.com/key-book-publishing-path/) is one view of all the traditional ways to bring a book to market.
