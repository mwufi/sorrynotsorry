oh yeah. that's right. it's also a phoenix server. so we can do things like this

```
<button class='px-4 py-2 border mb-4' onclick="console.log('hi')">Click me!</button>
```

<button class='px-4 py-2 border mb-4' onclick="alert('hi', 'the warden')">Click me!</button>

Lists should work
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

- some unordered lists
    - as well. does this look a bit smalelr to you?
