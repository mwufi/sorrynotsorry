        When your moat is too big, you stop noticing the leaks. An unbundling is triggered. Craigslist has been a grandfather for such rebirths. With Airbnb, Uber, Zillow and others. Within their niche they offered “sufficient departure” over Craiglist. With stronger acquisition and engagement loops.

        A network crash can occur if these issues are not navigated well. Like with Pyramid schemes. Positioned as perpetual motion machines. Mythical beasts. Powered by new entrants. Crashing the party when the fuel ends.

        The bigger players can make their moats stronger by bundling values together. Creating an ecosystem tying networks together. To grow further, spin off new atomic networks in different directions. Become a super-app. If the newer networks stick, welcome them into the network family. With open arms.",
